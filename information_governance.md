# Information governance

In order to to create a distributed Single View capability nationwide without an unmanageable burden of manual review and approval, we need to encode an information governance framework that can support automated machine-to-machine data sharing.

This means we need to be able to:
- assert the status of a request in relation to a use case or Data Processing Agreement
- provide enough information for the receiving system to make a decision on how to respond.

And we need to create the right conditions among partners:

- We are able to VALIDATE that an incoming enquiry is from an approved organisation
- The enquiry has a stated PURPOSE - using an agreed vocabulary
- There is robust LOGGING of enquiries and responses, providing a clear audit trail
- Automatable decision rules are agreed to govern ACCESS and sharing

# Formulating a MAIS data request for automated Information Governance...

Considering a Section 47 enquiry in children's social care, which mandates that local authorities initiate enquiries when there is reasonable cause to suspect a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm.

Our work in MAIS data exchange standards covers many other use cases, but this seemed a logical place to start.

Example: A basic s47 request at the highest level - do you know this person?

Assumptions:

- IT systems are recognised and validated, cyber security in place.
- Matching or searching systems for a person is appropriate / robust / comparable between systems (Note: Matching across Social Care is the subject of an upcoming workshop)
- All the above conditions are met.

# Next Steps

We recognise this is a complex challenge. There is no overarching Data Sharing Agreement between all potential parties in a safeguarding enquiry. [Working together to safeguard children 2023 ](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6849a7b67cba25f610c7db3f/Working_together_to_safeguard_children_2023_-_statutory_guidance.pdf) and the [ICO guidance on sharing information to safeguard children](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-sharing/a-10-step-guide-to-sharing-information-to-safeguard-children/) provide advice for sharing information where appropriate, including in situations where data sharing agreements or data protection impact assessments are not feasible.

Actions:
- Define the decision rules which permit systems to share relevant data in specific conditions
- Testing if the above pattern can extend to other use cases
- Create draft vocabularies for the reasons for a request
- Propose a technical recommendation for implementing automated information governance
